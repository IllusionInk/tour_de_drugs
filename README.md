# Tour De Drugs

>   The Tour de France is an annual men's multiple stage bicycle race primarily held in France. **The race is 3500kms long and last over 23 days.** 
Due to this intense nature of the sport, doping has been long associated with the race.The possibility of competition, rise in economic stakes produced a system of high rewards for winners.



### Need ?
---
  - Doping stories are fixated primarily on breaking down the journey for accused.
  - The damage done to the sport and other riders is often unknown.  The larger story provides users a larger context of the practice of doping on the entire sport.

### Story Structure
---
**Martini Glass Structure**
 - The narrative is author driven first introducing it,then moves to be a reder led initiative
 - The visualisation is built on Ben Shneiderman's principle of *Overview first, Details Later*; wherein I introduce the reader first to the concept of Tour De France and the history of doping in the sport. 
 - It then leads the reader to an exploratory dashboard,allowing him to comprehend the impact of doping on the sport; and further such analysis
